# Problem_Solving_C
Welcome to the Problem Solving in C Repository — a curated collection of programming exercises, conceptual explorations, and hands-on projects focused on mastering the C programming language. This repository is structured to help build core programming logic through:

📚 Structured practice modules (arrays, pointers, recursion, etc.)

🧠 Logical and algorithmic challenges

⚙️ Systems-level tasks (memory, data structures, file I/O)

💡 Concept deep-dives with code documentation

Whether you're learning C for the first time or reinforcing concepts through practical problem-solving, this repository is designed to provide a clear path from fundamentals to intermediate algorithmic fluency.

🔧 Topics Covered
✅ Arrays and pointers

✅ Recursion and call stack tracing

✅ Linked Lists (insert, delete, prepend, move)

✅ Queues and Priority Queues (circular buffer, custom structs)

✅ Matrices and 2D ADTs (with headers)

✅ String and character manipulation

✅ File I/O and header file management

✅ Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, chain tracing)

✅ Dynamic memory and structs

✅ Problem sets from academic courses and competitions
